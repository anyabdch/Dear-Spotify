# Dear-Spotify
A semi-immersive tour of my Spotify profile and why I'd be a good fit for a job there :)

In hopes that the Spotify recruiter who reads my application sees this -- I've built a page that shows 
my music taste, what it says about me, and why it would make me a good fit for the Band. Frontend is 
not my top skill so bear with me! I'm actively refining it while in school.

Also, in my cover letter I mentioned I have a running list of project suggestions -- I thought I'd share
it here for you to see:

If I Ever Get a Job At Spotify
- A shuffle algorithm that tunes into mood
      - study song sequences to dynamically update the queue
      - cause sometimes you're just in the mood for sad music but don't want it to affect 
        your overall shuffle!
- PocketConcert!! Definitely go check out the repo if you have a chance :)
- Have an option to have music fade out when the sleep timer ends, just like you can have between songs
- Transcripts available for all podcasts from an accessibility standpoint
- More advertisement that Spoitfy defaults to private listening
      - In interviews I did for a research project, a lot of people who chose not to use Spotify said their main
        reason was privacy concerns and that they didn't like the social aspect
- Be able to look up artists' songs on their profile
- Be able to opt playlists out of recommendation algorithms
      - My boyfriend complains a lot about his Discover Weekly being completely brown noise because
        he plays brown noise while he sleeps
